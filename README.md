## About <a name = "about"></a>

Color palettes for my projects. 

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have `node` and `npm`/`pnpm`installed in your computer.


### Installing

I recommend `pnpm` as package manager.

The steps will be:

```
pnpm i
```
or 
```
npm install
```

Then 

```
pnpm dev
```
or
```
npm run dev
```

Enjoy it!
## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

`netlify` is ready to use, you can configure it conveniently by editing `/netlify.toml` along with Github Actions.
